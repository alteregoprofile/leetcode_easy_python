#jewels and stones question 
#so the first is, stone can be jewel
#we want the output to be the number that holds value which is a total sum of STONES THAT ARE IN JEWELS!!!
#first we will need a counter to hold the value of this 
#we will have to loop such that for every item in stone, if it exists in jewel the counter should be increamented
